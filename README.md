## Task
I created a Timed Quiz , by using HTML, CSS and JS. I used various functions and global variables to make the quiz functional. I also used EventListeners to activate some functions by a click of a button. I made it where if the user got an answer wrong , time will be taken off from their Quiz Time.

I used some of my old work and these websites for more information:

 I also had help from my classmate Neema and my Tutor Zachary Auerbach.
